# vue-cli-plugin-element-up

ElementUp plugin for `@vue/cli` 3.0.

### Install

First you need to install `@vue/cli` globally (follow the instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the ElementUp plugin:

```bash
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add element-up
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how ElementUp is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.

### Use with vue-cli UI

Skip this part if you've done everything in the `Install` section.

If you prefer managing your project in vue-cli UI (by running `vue ui`), here's how you can add ElementUp plugin: go to the Plugins menu, click the upper right `+ Add plugin` button, find `vue-cli-plugin-element-up` and install it.
